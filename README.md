## Interactive maps for voxel-based morphometry results

This page provides the links to the interactive maps for the VBM results presented in Kweon et al. (2021). The anatomical regions are labeled according to Neuromorphometrics atlas. 

### Baseline VBM result
Univariate voxel-based morphometry (VBM) results on the two principal components for socioeconomic status (N = 23,931). Partial r-squared's (%) are plotted for Voxels significant at family-wise error rate of 5% level

### Baseline VBM result
Univariate voxel-based morphometry results on the polygenic index for socioeconomic status (N = 20,799, only individulas of European ancestry). Partial r-squared's (%) are plotted for Voxels significant at family-wise error rate of 5% level
